Context sensitive notifications for Android

## Overview

**Crouton** is a class that can be used by Android developers that feel the need for an **alternative to the Context insensitive [Toast](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/Toast.html)**.

A Crouton will be displayed at the position the developer decides.
Standard will be the of an application window.
You can line up multiple Croutons for display, that will be shown one after another.

You can check some features in the Crouton Demo.

## Usage

The API is kept as simple as the Toast API:

Create a Crouton for any CharSequence:

    Crouton.makeText(Activity, CharSequence, [Style]).show();
    
Create a Crouton with a String from your application's resources:

    Crouton.makeText(Activity, int, Style).show();
    
Further you can attach a Crouton to any view like this:

    Crouton.makeText(Activity, int, Style, int).show();

If you would like a more graphical introduction to Crouton check out [this presentation](https://speakerdeck.com/keyboardsurfer/crouton-devfest-berlin-2012).

##Important!

In your Activity.onDestroy() make sure to call

    Crouton.cancelAllCroutons();
    
to cancel cancel all scheduled Croutons.

This is a workaround and further description is available in [issue #24](https://github.com/keyboardsurfer/Crouton/issues/24).

## Basic Examples
Currently you can use the three different Style attributes displayed below out of the box:

![Alert](https://github.com/keyboardsurfer/Crouton/raw/master/res/Alert.png "Example of Style.ALERT")

![Confirm](https://github.com/keyboardsurfer/Crouton/raw/master/res/Confirm.png "Example of Style.CONFIRM")

![Info](https://github.com/keyboardsurfer/Crouton/raw/master/res/Info.png "Example of Style.INFO")

## Extension and Modification

The whole design of a Crouton is defined by [Style](https://github.com/keyboardsurfer/Crouton/blob/master/library/src/de/keyboardsurfer/android/widget/crouton/Style.java).

You can use one of the styles Crouton ships with: **Style.ALERT**, **Style.CONFIRM** and **Style.INFO**. Or you can create your own Style.

In general you can modify

- display duration
- dimension settings
- options for the text to display
- custom Views
- appearance & disappearance Animation
- displayed Image

Since [Style](https://github.com/keyboardsurfer/Crouton/blob/master/library/src/de/keyboardsurfer/android/widget/crouton/Style.java) is the general entry point for tweaking Croutons, go and see for yourself what can be done with it.


## Maven

### From maven central

Crouton is available in the maven central repository.

To use crouton simply add

```xml
<dependency>
  <artifactId>crouton</artifactId>
  <version>1.7</version>
  <groupId>de.keyboardsurfer.android.widget</groupId>
</dependency>
```

to your pom.xml

If you also want the sources or javadoc add the respective classifier  

```xml
  <classifier>sources</classifier>
```

or

```xml
  <classifier>javadoc</classifier>
```
to the dependency.

If you are referencing a newer version of the Android Support Library in your application, you might want to exclude Crouton's dependency like this:

```xml
<dependency>
	<artifactId>crouton</artifactId>
	<version>${crouton.version}</version>
	<groupId>de.keyboardsurfer.android.widget</groupId>
	<exclusions>
	    <exclusion>
	        <groupId>com.google.android</groupId>
	        <artifactId>support-v4</artifactId>
	    </exclusion>
	</exclusions>
</dependency>
```

### DIY

The build requires Maven. Operations are very simple:

* `mvn -f library/pom.xml clean package` will build a `jar` library;
* `mvn clean package` will build a `jar` library and the sample application `apk`;
* `mvn -f library/pom.xml clean install` will put Crouton in your local Maven repository.

After putting Crouton in the repository you can add it as a dependency.

```xml
<dependency>
  <artifactId>crouton</artifactId>
  <version>${crouton.version}</version>
  <groupId>de.keyboardsurfer.android.widget</groupId>
</dependency>
```
