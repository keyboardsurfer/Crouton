# Crouton

Context sensitive notifications for Android

## Overview

**Crouton**, is a class that can be used by Android developers that feel the need for an **alternative to the Context insensitive [Toast](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/Toast.html)**.

The name and the idea of [Crouton](https://github.com/neofoniemobile/Crouton/blob/master/src/de/neofonie/mobile/app/android/widget/crouton/Crouton.java) originates in a [blog article](http://android.cyrilmottier.com/?p=773) by Cyril Mottier.

A Crouton will be displayed at the top of an application window.
You can line up multiple Croutons for display, that will be shown one after another.

The current implementation requires the Holo theme to be present on the device.

### Usage

The API is kept as simple as the Toast API:

Create a Crouton for any CharSequence:

    Crouton.makeText(Activity, CharSequence, Style).show();
    
Create a Crouton with a String from your application's resources:

    Crouton.makeText(Activity, int, Style).show();

You can also cancel scheduled Croutons by calling:

    Crouton.cancelAllCroutons();

### Examples
Currently you can use the three different Style attributes displayed below:

![Alert](https://github.com/neofoniemobile/Crouton/raw/master/res/Alert.png "Example of Style.ALERT")

![Confirm](https://github.com/neofoniemobile/Crouton/raw/master/res/Confirm.png "Example of Style.CONFIRM")

![Info](https://github.com/neofoniemobile/Crouton/raw/master/res/Info.png "Example of Style.INFO")

### Extension and Modification

Color and display duration of a Crouton is defined by [Style](https://github.com/neofoniemobile/Crouton/blob/master/src/de/neofonie/mobile/app/android/widget/crouton/Style.java).
You can easily create your own Styles by adding them to the existing enum.

If you want to modify the general appearance you might want to have a look at the [ViewHolder](https://github.com/neofoniemobile/Crouton/blob/master/src/de/neofonie/mobile/app/android/widget/crouton/ViewHolder.java).

### Building

The build requires Maven. Operations are very simple:

* `mvn clean package` will build `jar` library;
* `mvn clean install` will put Crouton in your local Maven repository.

After putting Crouton in the repository you can add it as a dependency.

```xml
<dependency>
  <artifactId>crouton</artifactId>
  <version>1.1</version>
  <groupId>de.neofonie</groupId>
</dependency>
```
